# Red-black tree
Red-black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores information about its "color". It is used to ensure the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. After each action from the menu, the program waits pressing Enter.

## Complexity
**Space complexity - O(n)**

**Searching - O(n)**

**Insertion - O(log n)**

**Deleting - O(log n)**

## Insertion
It is possible to insert an element or elements into the tree.
